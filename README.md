## Solutions

1. The first solution that is, on the top of my head, is just the usual two loops. In the first one I take the first element of
   Array and the second loop take the next element after the first one and check. If the sum is equal to the value I am looking for,
   I will return the Array with the first element and the next one. But if not I carry on to iterate the second loop.
 > Work's time of this solution - `O(nÂ²)` and memory - `O(1)`;
